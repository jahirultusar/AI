# Running Jupyter locally

We can run notebooks inside other cloud environments such as [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), [Sagemaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/), and [Paperspace Gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks). Or you can run a Jupyter Notebook server from your local computer. What's more, if you have installed Anaconda you don't even need to install Jupyter (if not, just `pip install jupyter`).

You just need to run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. Remember to run it from a folder that contains all the folders/files you will want to access. You will be able to open, view, and edit files located within the directory in which you run this command but not files in parent directories.

If a browser tab does not open automatically once you run the command, you should CTRL+CLICK the link starting with 'http://localhost:' and this will open a new tab in your default browser.
