# Why deep learning? https://course.fast.ai/#why-deep-learning

Deep learning has power, flexibility, and simplicity. That’s why we believe it should be applied across many disciplines. These include the social and physical sciences, the arts, medicine, finance, scientific research, and many more. Here’s a list of some of the thousands of tasks in different areas at which deep learning, or methods heavily using deep learning, is now the best in the world:

    Natural language processing (NLP) Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
    
    Computer vision Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
    
    Medicine Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
    
    Biology Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
    
    Image generation Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
    Recommendation systems Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
    
    Playing games Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
    
    Robotics Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
    
    Other applications Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more…


# My Goal from this course 

    * How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in:

        - Computer vision, including image classification (e.g., classifying pet photos by breed)
        - Natural language processing (NLP), including document classification (e.g., movie review sentiment analysis) and phrase similarity
        - Tabular data with categorical data, continuous data, and mixed data
        - Collaborative filtering (e.g., movie recommendation)

    * How to turn your models into web applications, and deploy them

    * Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models

    * The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice

    * How to implement stochastic gradient descent and a complete training loop from scratch


Here are some of the techniques covered (don’t worry if none of these words mean anything to you yet–you’ll learn them all soon):

    * Random forests and gradient boosting

    * Affine functions and nonlinearities

    * Parameters and activations

    * Transfer 
    
    * Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

    * Data augmentation

    * Weight decay

    * Image classification

    * Entity and word embeddings
